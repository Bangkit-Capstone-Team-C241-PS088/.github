## Our Background 
Novice ornamental fish enthusiasts often face challenges diagnosing and treating illnesses, resulting in significant fish loss, discouragement, and abandoning the hobby. Current solutions are either intricate or out of reach for beginners. This project proposes a user-friendly mobile application specifically geared towards novice fish keepers. The app addresses the hurdle of disease diagnosis through a combination of AI-powered image recognition for visual identification using smartphone cameras, and symptom-based diagnosis for less visually evident diseases. 

This empowers novice fish keepers, leading to reduced fish mortality due to timely and accurate identification, increased confidence through effective fish health management tools, and ultimately, enhanced enjoyment of the hobby by alleviating the fear of losing fish. The project aims to reduce dropout rates among beginners by evaluating the app's effectiveness in retaining new hobbyists, optimize the user experience by identifying the most valuable features for disease diagnosis and treatment, validate the accuracy of combining image analysis and textual symptoms for diagnosis, and explore the app's potential to promote preventative care practices.
